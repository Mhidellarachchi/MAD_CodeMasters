y2s2 android application project for an online food delivary app
Introduction to the project
Topic- Mobile application for a restaurant 

With the increase in technological advancements, mobile application usage has been rapidly increasing across the globe. With the rapid increase in smartphone and tablet usage, businesses are using mobile apps as an opportunity to improve their services and build a stronger brand value. Mobile applications have several advantages like an increase in customer engagements because itâ€™s available at any time and anywhere, improved customer loyalty, having a competitive edge in the industry, offering better customer services, and so on.

In this project, we are aiming to develop an android application to order products online from a restaurant. Firstly, the customers should register/log in to the system. Afterward, the customer will be able to see different types of food items which are divided by categories. The customer can put needed food items into their cart and edit/delete their order as necessary. Then the customer should input the delivery address, and phone number and select the preferred payment method. After this, the workers in the restaurant will be able to see the order and then the ordered food will be delivered accordingly.

Another user in this system is the admin. Admin is in charge of several functions within the system. He/she is able to view the mobile application the same way as a customer but is also able to edit/add food products, and categories into the system. The admin can also add different offers within this system. He/she will be overseeing how the mobile application operates. This mobile application will be helpful for the customers to gain good customer satisfaction as well as for the restaurant to gain more customer loyalty and a brand value.
